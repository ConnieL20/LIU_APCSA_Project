     * Used to create one of the rooms in the dragon’s lair; there are a total of 5 rooms.
     * Should store the room’s name (e.g. “the den”), how many dragons are spawned and/or remain to be killed, whether the room has been cleared, and whether the room has already been searched for a health pot (a player can only search a room once).
     * Should have methods to enter the room and to search the room (allowing the player to possibly discover a health pot).
     * Should include any other static or instance variables and/or methods, including getters/setters and private helper methods, that you determine are necessary to implement the requirements.
