     * Used to create the player.
     * Should store the player’s name, health, gold, health pot status (has one or doesn’t), and sword (Sword class).
     * Should have methods to attack (including determine attack amount), handle an incoming attack (including updating the player’s own health), and use a health pot (if the player is carrying one).
     * You should also consider including methods related to menu options that deal with the player, such as checking player health level or the player’s sword stats.
     * Should include any other static or instance variables and/or methods, including getters/setters and private helper methods, that you determine are necessary to implement the requirements.
